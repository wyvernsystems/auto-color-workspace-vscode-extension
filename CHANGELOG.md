# Changelog

All notable changes to **Auto Color** will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Existing workspace settings:** If `.vscode/settings.json` is already present, or a multi-root `.code-workspace` file already has a non-empty `settings` object, Auto Color **does not** read or write workspace settings on window open, when workspace folders change, or when `auto-color.*` settings change. That avoids silently merging into or overwriting configuration you already rely on. Run a command when you want the tint—for example **Auto Color: Enable for this workspace**, **Randomize color**, **Reset to default color**, **Set color scope**, or **Enable (all windows)** (with a folder open)—to merge colors into `workbench.colorCustomizations` as before.
- **Greenfield workspaces:** If there is no workspace settings file yet, automatic tint on load is unchanged; the extension still creates `.vscode/settings.json` when it applies colors.

### Changed

- **README:** Expanded **What it does** (when Auto Color stays hands-off vs when you use a command); **File it writes** cross-reference; spelling, grammar, and markdown fixes; **Examples** screenshots wired up again.

[1.0.4]: https://github.com/wyvernsystems/auto-color-vscode-extension/releases/tag/v1.0.4

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- README: **Examples** section at the bottom; removed privacy note under screenshots.

[1.0.3]: https://github.com/wyvernsystems/auto-color-vscode-extension/releases/tag/v1.0.3

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **Workspace Trust:** Removed `untrustedWorkspaces` manifest restrictions and all trust checks so Auto Color works immediately without requiring the user to trust the workspace (easier default experience). Other hardening (e.g. `crypto` random seed, path length cap, seed validation, `.vscodeignore` patterns) remains.

[1.0.2]: https://github.com/wyvernsystems/auto-color-vscode-extension/releases/tag/v1.0.2

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-13

### Security

- **Workspace Trust:** `capabilities.untrustedWorkspaces` set to **limited**; workspace-level `auto-color.workspaceDisabled`, `scope`, and `randomSeed` are restricted until the workspace is trusted. No writes to `workbench.colorCustomizations` while untrusted; reapplies after trust is granted.
- **Commands** that mutate workspace settings require a trusted workspace (with user-visible warning otherwise). **Disable (all windows)** warns if workspace keys could not be cleared while untrusted.
- **Random seed:** `randomSeed` validated as finite; **Randomize** uses `crypto.randomBytes` instead of `Math.random`.
- **Path hash:** folder path length capped before hashing to limit CPU work on abnormal paths.
- **Packaging:** `.vscodeignore` excludes common secret filename patterns from the VSIX.
- **Repo:** [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), Dependabot for npm, README security summary.

[1.0.1]: https://github.com/wyvernsystems/auto-color-vscode-extension/releases/tag/v1.0.1

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **New Marketplace extension** `WyvernSystemsLLC.auto-color` (package name `auto-color`, display name **Auto Color**).
- Commands and settings use the `auto-color.*` prefix (replaces `autocolor-workspace.*`).

### Notes

- Successor to **AutoColorWorkspace** (`WyvernSystemsLLC.autocolor-workspace`). Migrate by installing **Auto Color**, uninstalling the old extension, and updating User/Workspace JSON: `autocolor-workspace.*` → `auto-color.*` if you had overrides.

[1.0.0]: https://github.com/wyvernsystems/auto-color-vscode-extension/releases/tag/v1.0.0
